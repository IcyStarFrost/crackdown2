# Crackdown 2 
## This is no longer being developed as I lost interest in gmod. Do whatever you want with this as long as you credit me as usual


A Garry's Mod Recreation of the 2010 Crackdown 2 game originally released on Xbox 360

Keys to the City setting turns off progression and campaign scripted events. It also gives you a menu to spawn things and do other stuff such as setting skills. To use the panel, use the up and down keys to scroll and press `enter` to click on a option. When in a folder, press `backspace` to back out of it

The main campaign is perfectly playable from start to finish on any map that has a navmesh. It is required the map you play on has a navmesh or else you can't play the gamemode. You should play on large maps like gm_bigcity for best experience.

Simply place the crackdown2 gamemode in your gamemodes folder at, `DRIVE:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\gamemodes`. When you play the gamemode, disable every addon you have or else they may ruin the experience
